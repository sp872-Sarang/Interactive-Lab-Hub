#RIOC Bus Tracker Project

## Problem Statement 
Roosevelt Island residents(specifically Cornell Tech Students) are not aware of the RedBus schedule in realtime. The schedule is posted on a static page which can be found here, which varies based on rush hour and driver availability. From experience this has not been consistent and can lead to wait time from anywhere between 2min to 20min.

## Problem Description
We hope to create a device people can interact with to be aware of bus schedules. We also hope to study user interactions with the red bus, specifically, learn the number of students using the bus and the pain points as to when they don't want to use it.

## User Research 
To begin our project, we reached out to a few friends who live in the house to ask them about their experiences taking the RIOC bus. Most of them prefer to walk to Main Street because itâ€™s faster, and generally avoid taking the red bus. In general, people seemed to be averse to taking the RIOC bus for the sake of efficiency - they were unsure of where the bus is, when it would arrive, and preferred to avoid relying on the 15-minute estimate offered by RIOC. However, two students mentioned that they would be more likely to travel via bus if the bus schedule offered more detailed information on this mode of transportation. Overall, it seems that a lack of awareness about the bus, avoidance of relying on estimated bus schedules, and a preference for walking are some of the pain points that residents of Roosevelt Island experienced when it comes to engaging with the RIOC bus system. In conclusion, there are a few main things we wanted to keep in mind going forward: [1] There exists a lack of information on bus times, which leads to erratic wait times for students, [2] Students are not aware that an online bus schedule exists, and [3] students reported that they would take the bus if they anticipated its arrival, however it was the lack of available information which caused the greatest amount of inconvenience and uncertainty.

# Storyboard & Verplank Diagram 
For our storyboard and verplank diagram our goal was to convey the inefficiencies that emerge when interacting with the bus network. We re-create an experience many Roosevelt Island residents can relate to; traveling to the bus stop, only to experience odd departure and arrival times, ultimately reducing the users ability to interact with the system. The breakthrough occurs when our subject, Jack, notices a new, innovative product that resolves this issue - the bus tracker system, which ensures that users have the best understanding of when and where to catch the bus.
